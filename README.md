## Name
UMD_Ipelets

## Description
This is a project to assemble Ipelets for many general polygonal operations used by the field of convex geometry.

## Ipelets
We have several Ipelets available for use they are:
1. Polygon Operations (Union, Intersection, Subtraction)
2. Minkowski Sum
3. Minimum Enclosing Ball
4. Polar Body
5. Macbeath Region
6. Funk and Reverse Funk Balls
7. Hilbert Balls
8. Minimum Spanning Tree (maximum Funk, Hilbert, Euclidean)

## Installation
Download the files, and put them in the Ipelets subfolder folder in your Ipe folder.

## Usage
They should appear under Ipelets.

## Support
If there are issues email octavo@umd.edu

## Roadmap
We will continue to put up more Ipelets for basic computational geometry operations in the polygonal goeometry.
