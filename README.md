## Name
UMD_Ipelets

## Description
This is a project to assemble ipelets for many general polygonal operations used by the field of convex geometry.

## Installation
Download the files, put them in the ipelet folder in your ipe file.

## Usage
They should appear under ipelets.

## Support
If there are issues email me at octavo@umd.edu

## Roadmap
We will continue to put up more iplets for basic computational geomtry operations in the polygonal goeometry.
