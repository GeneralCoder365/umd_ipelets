## Name
UMD_Ipelets

## Description
This is a project to assemble ipelets for many general polygonal operations used by the field of convex geometry.

## Ipelets
We have several ipelets available for use they are:
1. Minkowski Sum
2. Polar Body
3. Macbeath Region
5. Minimum Spanning Tree
6. Minimum Enclosing Ball
7. Hilbert Balls
8. Funk and Reverse Funk Balls

## Installation
Download the files, put them in the Ipelet folder in your Ipe file.

## Usage
They should appear under Ipelets.

## Support
If there are issues email octavo@umd.edu

## Roadmap
We will continue to put up more Ipelets for basic computational geometry operations in the polygonal goeometry.
